            <dt>How do you go about choosing your products?</dt>
            <dd>
              We use an environmental watchdog called
              <a href="https://www.ewg.org/">EWG</a> to research our products
              carefully. This ensures that weâ€™re using the safest products for
              you, your family, and the environment.
            </dd>

            <dt>What services do you provide?</dt>
            <dd>
              We provide standard cleans, deep cleans, and vacation rental
              cleans. For a list of what these services include, please view our
              <a href="services.html">services page.</a>
            </dd>
            <dt>
              Do eco-friendly cleaners work as well as normal cleaning
              chemicals?
            </dt>
            <dd>
              Eco products clean work well but for homes with a high dirt level
              you may just need bleach. If this is the case we might not be the
              best match for you. In order to determine this, we recommend
              texting us pictures of the problem areas to
              <a href="tel:5099038025">509-903-8025</a>.
            </dd>

            <dt>What if something is damaged during the cleaning?</dt>
            <dd>
              We recommend that you either put away valuable/breakable items or
              make a note to not have them touched. If an accidental breakage
              does occur we will contact you immediately to arrange a
              replacement/repair.
            </dd>
            <dt>Is your company pet-friendly?</dt>
            <dd>
              We love pets, however, if you feel you have an aggressive pet or a
              pet that will interfere with our work, we suggest you isolate them
              from the cleaners, or kindly book your appointment when someone is
              there to help. If you have an indoor-only cat please let us know
              so we can make sure your pet does not get out.
